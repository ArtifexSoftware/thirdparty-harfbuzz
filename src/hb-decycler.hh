/*
 * hb_decycler_t is an efficient cycle detector for graph traversal.
 * It's a simple tortoise-and-hare algorithm with a twist: it's
 * designed to detect cycles while traversing a graph in a DFS manner,
 * instead of just a linked list.
 *
 * For Floyd's tortoise and hare algorithm, see:
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_detection#Floyd's_tortoise_and_hare
 *
 * Like Floyd's algorithm, hb_decycler_t is O(n) in the number of nodes
 * in the graph.  Unlike Floyd's algorithm, hb_decycler_t is designed
 * to be used in a DFS traversal, where the graph is not a simple
 * linked list, but a tree with cycles.  The decycler works by creating
 * an implicit linked-list on the stack, of the path from the root to
 * the current node, and apply Floyd's algorithm on that list as it goes.
 *
 * The decycler is malloc-free, and as such, much faster to use than a
 * hb_set_t or hb_map_t equivalent.
 *
 * The decycler detects cycles in the graph *eventually*, not *immediately*.
 * That is, it may not detect a cycle until the cycle is fully traversed,
 * even multiple times. See Floyd's algorithm analysis for details.
 *
 * For usage examples see test-decycler.cc.
